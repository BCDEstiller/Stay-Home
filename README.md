Stay@Home - COVID 19 Tracker for Windows
## Installation
Version 1.0 is now launched as a standalone file. No need to install.
I still haven't signed the executable so windows might not recognize the file.
Download it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/189Ufmn0Qlqz1dhGGfbH7xLXHM0hT9obK?usp=sharing).
